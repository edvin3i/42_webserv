+ -b, --benchmark
    BENCHMARK, runs the test with NO DELAY for throughput benchmarking. By default each simulated user is invoked with at least a one second delay. This option removes that delay. It is not recommended that you use this option while load testing. 

+ -t NUMm, --time=NUMm
    TIME, allows you to run the test for a selected period of time. The format is "NUMm", where NUM is a time unit and the "m" modifier is either S, M, or H for seconds, minutes and hours. To run siege for an hour, you could select any one of the following combinations: -t3600S, -t60M, -t1H. The modifier is not case sensitive, but it does require no space between the number and itself.
